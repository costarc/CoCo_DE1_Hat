This project as adapted from my MSX DE1 hat for DE1 (https://github.com/costarc/MSX_FPGA_Hat).

The MSX version was fabricated, tested and verified to work.

This CoCo version was not tested yet, therefore you use it at your own risks.

As soon as I fabricate and assembly this PCB, I will update this README with actual status.
