# CoCo_FPGA_Hat
A Cartridge interface that converts TRS-Color 5v signal levels in the bus to 3.3v, exposed over an IDC connector for external devices that operates at 3.3v level.

Allow the use of FGPA development boards such as Terasic DE0 and DE1 as generic peripherals.

This project as adapted from my MSX DE1 hat for DE1 (https://github.com/costarc/MSX_FPGA_Hat).


THIS IS WORKING IN PROGRESS. THE BOARD IS BEING TESTED, AND REFERENCE DESIGNS CREATED.

THIS PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR FABRICATON!!

IF YOU SEND FOR PRODUCTION, BE AWARE IT MIGHT NOT WORK, OR ONLY WORK WITH SEVERAL MANUAL FIXES TO THE BOARD.
